    "I taught myself C#, Unity, and pixel art all in the name of love! Every line of code and every single pixel was written by myself (but the music was sourced from the web). This project took me over a year to complete, all in secret, behind my life partner's back! Check out the video linked here (skip to 13:50 to see the good stuff). Now we are married, so all the hard work paid off!"
